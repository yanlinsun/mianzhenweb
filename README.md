# Face Diagnose Toy

It is a project that I used to learn and practice jQuery and Bootstrap.
This tool is inspired by the [How-Old.net](http://how-old.net).
It uses Microsoft Azure Face API.
It calculates the face portions, like forehead, eye, jaw, by the detected face elements points from Face API result. 

**How to use**

1. Select a picture from your local computer. 

    * It is required to be no more than 3MB in size. 
    * A picture has only one person. Because it ***only calculates face portions for the first face only***.
    
2. Wait until it finishes detection

3. You can check each single portion by left side buttons
